# Malicious_Traffic_Exercises
My answers for exercises on Malware Traffic Analysis

## About This Repository
As I complete the exercises on Malware-Traffic-Analysis (in no particular order), I will upload my answers to the appropriate folder. There are a variety of exercises with some asking guiding questions and some being a bit more free form. Most exercises will center around their pcap, but I may use some additional tools to further analyze malware and malicious networks. I will complete the exercises as requested as opposed to adding a "walkthrough" type narrative (excepted where required).

### Completed Exercises

### Safety Note
This repository does not contain any malicious pcaps or files. However, the exercise files on malware-traffic-analysis.net should be considered malicious and treated accordingly. I will be completing these exercises inside of a Win10 VM provisioned with FLARE. No dynamic analysis will be conducted.
